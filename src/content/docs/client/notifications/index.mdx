## Setup

<LibBuilder componentName="notifications" client:load />


You may ask "what does local notifications" have to do with device or background services?  Well.... turns out quite a bit.  You need a way
of letting your users know that you've done something in the background.  Maybe your job ran and determined that you need to do something OR you connected
to a BLE peripheral... who knows, but you'll definitely need local notifications at some point well using Shiny 


## iOS Specifics
There isn't anything specific to setting up local notifications on iOS.  However,
iOS has one specific rule - While the application  is running in the **FOREGROUND**, notifications will not be displayed.
You are responsible for notifying your users of actions happening while your app is running.  


## Android Specifics
Android has many different customization points - please review the [Android Specifics Documentation](xref:notifications-android)


# Notifications
First rule, as with any Shiny service.  Run RequestAccess

```csharp
var result = await ShinyHost.Resolve<INotificationManager>().RequestAccess();
if (result == PermissionState.Available) {
    // ... do something
}
```

## Scheduling
:::warning
iOS requires the 'Time Sensitive Notification' entitlement that is setup for your app on the Apple Developer Portal.

You must then add the following to your 'Entitlement.plist' or csproj file
```xml
<key>com.apple.developer.usernotifications.time-sensitive</key>
<true />

<!-- OR -->
<ItemGroup>
    <CustomEntitlements Include="com.apple.developer.usernotifications.time-sensitive" Type="Boolean" Value="true" />
</ItemGroup>

## Notification Responses
```cs
using System.Threading.Tasks;
using Shiny.Notifications;

public class NotificationDelegate : INotificationDelegate
{
    public async Task OnEntry(NotificationResponse response)
    {
    }
}

```

## Android Notification Entry

In order for Shiny to receive Android notification entries, you must add the following to your `MainActivity.cs` file

```csharp
using Android.App;
using Android.Content.PM;

namespace YourNamespace;

[Activity(
    Theme = "@style/Maui.SplashTheme",
    MainLauncher = true,
    ConfigurationChanges =
        ConfigChanges.ScreenSize |
        ConfigChanges.Orientation |
        ConfigChanges.UiMode |
        ConfigChanges.ScreenLayout |
        ConfigChanges.SmallestScreenSize |
        ConfigChanges.Density
)]
[IntentFilter(new[] {
    Shiny.ShinyNotificationIntents.NotificationClickAction
})]
public class MainActivity : MauiAppCompatActivity
{
}
```
