:::note[iOS: The IPushDelegate.OnReceived is not firing]
You must ensure that your push payload includes content-available: 1
:::

:::note[Android: The IPushDelegate.OnReceived is not firing]
You must include `data` in your push payload
:::

:::note[Android: I'm not receiving the actual notification content]
If you're in the app, you won't receive the notification content.
:::

:::note[Android: When I tap on the notification, IPushDelegate.OnEntry is not firing]
You must set the `click_action` in your notification payload.  You also have to ensure that this matches the `IntentFilter` in your `MainActivity` which needs to be "SHINY_PUSH_NOTIFICATION_CLICK"
so Shiny knows to pick it up and run the delegate

```csharp
[IntentFilter(
    new[] {
        Shiny.ShinyPushIntents.NotificationClickAction
    },
    Categories = new[] { 
        "android.intent.category.DEFAULT" 
    }
)]
public class MainActivity : MauiAppCompatActivity // or whatever activity type you use
{
}
```
:::

:::caution[iOS: I stopped receiving notifications]
You can only send 3-5 notifications per hour that contain content-available: 1.  You can still send normal notifications (the delegate just won't fire) without Shiny getting involved.
