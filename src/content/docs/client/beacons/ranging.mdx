title: Beacons - Ranging
---

import LibBuilder from '../../../../components/Boilerplate/LibBuilder';

Beacon ranging is NOT a background operation.  Beacon ranging allows you to get all information. 

## Setup

<LibBuilder componentName="beacons" client:load />

## Scanning

This is obviously the entirely reason for beacons.  Ranging is great for setup based operations on setting beacons for contextual
location based operations.  

```csharp
IBeaconRangingManager rangingManager; // resolve it from your container or inject it

var subscription = rangingManager
    .WhenBeaconRanged(new BeaconRegion(
        "MyBeacons",
        new Guid("00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000000"), // your uuid
        1, // OPTIONAL: major
        1  // OPTIONAL: minor
    ))
    .Subscribe(beacon => 
    {
        beacon.Proximity;
        beacon.Major;
        beacon.Minor;
    });

// when you're done
subscription.Dispose();
```

## Managed Scan

The managed scan is meant to make it easier to show scan results for beacons.  It will manage things like

* Thread safety on the list
* Changes within the list (beacon ranges changing)
* Removing items from the list if they have haven't been header
* Ensure performance by using proper buffering techniques behind the scenes

```csharp
IBeaconRangingManager rangingManager;

var scanner = rangingManager.CreateManagedScan();
scanner.Start();


scanner.Dispose(); // <= make sure to dispose when you're done! 
```
