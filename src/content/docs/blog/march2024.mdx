## Shiny v3.3

This release was mainly a large bugfixing release, however, we did decide to remove two modules from the Shiny offering
* Shiny.Logging.AppCenter - this was an easy one.  Microsoft is shutting down AppCenter in 2025. 
* Shiny.SpeechRecognition - this was a tough one.  The plugin was never really that great and it was a pain to maintain.  The MAUI community toolkit recently released a plugin here that you can use.

We did include some breaking changes to improve the events you can work with on Shiny.Push which adds the ability
to listen for UnRegistration events of your push token.

## Shiny Templates v2.4

The templates have been great for Shiny discovery.  Wiring up all of the permissions with Android & iOS is difficult.  I find that I'm constantly using
[App Builder](/client/appbuilder) here on shinylib.net to generate them all for me because I constantly forget them all.  Cutting a new proof-of-concept or test with
Shiny or any of the whack of 3rd party libraries that are included with the library is a breeze.

This release got the following love:
* Removal of AppCenter - maybe this is the opposite of love - but don't use it since it is officially done in 2025
* Updated to the latest versions of many nuget packages
* Updated some of the Shiny stuff to 3.3
* NEW base template for the upcoming Apple Privacy Manifests under Platforms/iOS

The MAUI Project template is so large that it takes 3 screenshots to get it all.

## Push Notification End-to-End Tester for Azure Notification Hubs & Firebase

Setting up push notifications with Apple & Google can be a real pain. This tool will help you test your setup end-to-end.  It's a 
simple mobile app that will send a push notification to your app using Azure Notification Hubs or Firebase Cloud Messaging.  It's a great way to test your setup without having to write a bunch of code.

It isn't pretty, but it does a good job of helping you test your setup without having to wire up a backend or write a bunch of code.

## Shiny 4.0 Roadmap

We are starting to plan out Shiny 4.0.  We are looking for feedback on what you would like to see in the next major version of Shiny.

Currently on the roadmap are:

- Simplifying the Job framework
- Allow for more native configuration of Push & Local Notifications
- More BLE methods to help with some of the fun edge cases that have been rolling in
- Removing the old Xamarin/Netstandard targets.  This will help with new targets moving forward
- Continue to improve the hosting model to work with other platform vendors like Uno
- Trying to get RX out of the core for those that don't want the fat (MAYBE)

So it's a "smaller" major release.

## Bonus - ACR User Dialogs

There are still people using my old dinosaur of a package, so I updated it to the latest AndroidX stuff and .NET 8.  
Unfortunately, classic Xamarin and netstandard targets are now gone, but at least it pushes the needle forward if you're still using
this package.
